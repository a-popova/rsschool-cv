            <li><strong>Name:</strong> Anastasiya Popova</li>
            <li><strong>Contact me:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anastasiya-popova-b1368a79/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/anastasia.popova.35912">Facebook</a></li>
            <li><strong>Goals:</strong>My goal and my mission in life is to be a happy person. Happiness is understood in different ways. I deem it as a successful combination of multiple spheres of life such as family, work, hobbies, etc. Only having all of them together and in preferable portions makes me feel happy. As for my work ambitions, I am ready to learn something new and grow as a professional. Programming is a sphere that I'd like to dedicate my time and efforts to. Despite of having a liberal education, I feel that I can fullfil my potential here.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Skills:</strong> JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, git, MongoDB, PostreSQL, Jira, Atlassian; Scrum, Kanban</li>
            <li><strong>Code example:</strong> 
            (javascript)
            <br>
            function sumCubes(n){
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;let sum = 0;
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++){
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sum += i*i*i;
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;return sum;
              <br>
            }
            </li>
            <li><strong>Experience:</strong> I don't have yet much experience. Nevertheless, I have been practising solving tasks on <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a> and improving my coding skills. You can see my Profile <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/a-popova">here</a>. Also, I try to learn something new by coding different projects such as calculator, to-do list, etc. </li>
            <li><strong>Education:</strong> I finished Gomel State Regional lyceum (specialization - English) and moved to Vilnius to study Cultural Heritage and Tourism at European Humanities University. Also, I have spent one year abroad (Germany) by doing Erasmus exchange program. Then I came back to Belarus and tried to work in tourism sphere. Eight months was enough period for me to understand that I want to try something different. I chose IT sphere because I have many friends in there and completed courses <em>"Software Testing"</em>(manual). While working as a QA engineer, I became more and more interested in programming and started to learn it in my spare time. Interest became more serious and I decided that I am ready to devote more time to it, so now I am taking courses by Rolling Scopes community.</li>
            <li><strong>English:</strong> currently my level is B2. I can communicate with natives quite fluently, watch movies and series in English.</li>
