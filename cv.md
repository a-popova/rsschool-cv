3. My goal and my mission in life is to be a happy person. Happiness is understood in different ways. I deem it as a successful combination of multiple spheres of life such as family, work, hobbies, etc. Only having all of them together and in preferable portions makes me feel happy. As for my work ambitions, I am ready to learn something new and grow as a professional. Programming is a sphere that I'd like to dedicate my time and efforts to. Despite of having a liberal education, I feel that I can fullfil my potential here.
4. **Skills:** JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, git, MongoDB, PostreSQL, Jira, Atlassian; Scrum, Kanban
